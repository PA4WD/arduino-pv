This library allows communication of an Arduino with a SunEzy inverter, connected via the serial port.

Still not tested and in development.

Based on https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=pv

Please note that, even though the python library has only been tested with a CMS-2000 inverter and a SunEzy 600E, it also worked on my SunEzy 2810, and it believe this would be the case for every SunEzy inverter, as long as it has a serial port and can be queried by the SunEzy Control software.
